      "title": "A response to your petition on the OPT STEM regulation:",
      "body": "<p>On September 8, <a href=\"https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/propose-proper-regulation-extending-stem-opt-022016-avoid-expected-shock-both-firms-and-students\" style=\"color: #336699;\">a petition you signed</a> -- asking the Administration to put in place a new set of rules for the extension of the Optional Practical Training program for international students in science, technology, engineering, and math (\"OPT STEM\") -- reached 100,000 signatures, the threshold for receiving a White House response.</p>\n\n      <p>First, thanks for using We the People. In order to get information to respond to your request, we consulted with folks from the Department of Homeland Security -- the agency that administers the OPT STEM program. Here's what we can share:</p>\n\n      <p>For more than 200 years, the United States has welcomed immigrants and refugees from around the world into our nation, enhancing our diversity, culture, and economy. Today, many individuals contributing to the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields are immigrants or refugees, and research indicates that skilled immigrants make outsized contributions to innovation and entrepreneurship, which helps grow our economy and create jobs for all Americans. That is why the President has consistently advocated for commonsense comprehensive immigration reform legislation that would help certain foreign students who graduate with STEM degrees to stay here and contribute to our economy by providing these individuals with avenues to obtain lawful permanent residence (or \"green cards\").</p>\n\n      <p>Last November, the President announced a number of reforms designed to fix parts of our broken immigration system -- including actions to strengthen the Optional Practical Training (OPT) STEM program. <strong>Last week, the Department of Homeland Security published a proposed regulation to accomplish this goal. DHS is inviting the public, including students, colleges and universities, and employers, to review its proposed reforms and provide feedback by November 18, 2015.</strong> After DHS reviews and considers all public comments, it plans to publish a final rule.</p>\n\n      <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/10/19/2015-26395/improving-and-expanding-training-opportunities-for-f-1-nonimmigrant-students-with-stem-degrees-and\" style=\"color: #336699;\">You can read the proposed regulation here.</a></strong></p>\n\n      <p>Wondering what exactly this process is all about? Here's a quick run-down:</p>\n\n      <p>Federal regulations are created through a rulemaking process. These regulations provide a roadmap for how federal agencies will implement certain laws, policies, and programs. Once an agency decides it should take a regulatory action, that agency will typically develop and publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (or \"NPRM\") in the Federal Register -- the official daily publication for agency rules, proposed rules, and notices of Federal agencies and organizations, as well as Executive Orders and other Presidential documents. (<a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov\" style=\"color: #336699;\">You can take a look here.</a>) Once the NPRM is published, the agency begins soliciting comments from the public about the proposed rule. After the comment period closes, the rulemaking agency considers every comment, and makes any changes in the rule where appropriate. The final rule typically incorporates feedback and changes from the comment period and is then published in the Federal Register. A final rule will include a specific date on which the rule will become effective. To learn more about the rulemaking process, visit, <a href=\"http://www.reginfo.gov/public/jsp/Utilities/faq.jsp\" style=\"color: #336699;\">www.reginfo.gov</a> -- and take a look at some commonly asked questions and answers about the process here. </p>\n\n      <p>For more information on the President’s immigration executive actions, including improvements to attract high skilled graduates and entrepreneurs, visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/11/25/taking-action-attract-high-skilled-immigrants-graduates-and-entrepreneurs\" style=\"color: #336699;\">https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/11/25/taking-action-attract-high-skilled-immigrants-graduates-and-entrepreneurs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/immigration/immigration-action\" style=\"color: #336699;\">www.whitehouse.gov/immigration-action</a>.</p> \n\n      <p>And to get more updates on immigration issues, please visit <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/immigration\" style=\"color: #336699;\">www.whitehouse.gov/immigration</a>. </p>\n\n      <p>Thank you for your participation in the We the People platform -- we’ll be back in touch soon.</p>\n\n      <p>-- The We the People Team</p>\n\n      <hr />\n\n      <p><em><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/webform/tell-us-what-you-think-about-we-people-and-petition-response-opt-stem-regulations\" style=\"color: #336699;\">Tell us what you think about this response and We the People.</a></em></p>",

Today, there's more to say. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) -- the relevant body within the federal government responsible for addressing this issue -- announced that the Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractors (DME MACs) will not finalize the draft Lower Limb Prostheses Local Coverage Determination (LCD) (DL33787) at this time. <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coverage/DeterminationProcess/Downloads/LLP_IAWG_Announcement.pdf\" style=\"color:#336699;\" target=\"_blank\">You can read the official announcement here.</a></p>\n\n      <p>Here's what else they'd like you to know:</p>\n\n      <p><strong>CMS is committed to providing high quality care to all Medicare beneficiaries, including any beneficiary in need of a prosthesis. Both CMS and its contractors have heard your concerns about access to prostheses for Medicare beneficiaries.</strong></p>\n\n      <p>After a preliminary review of the public comments, CMS is convening a multidisciplinary Lower Limb Prostheses Interagency Workgroup (Workgroup) in 2016. The purpose of the Workgroup is to develop a consensus statement that informs Medicare policy by reviewing the available clinical evidence that defines best practices in the care of beneficiaries who require lower limb prostheses. The Workgroup will be comprised of clinicians, researchers, and policy specialists from different federal agencies. The Workgroup may also identify areas where evidence gaps exist related to the prescription of lower extremity prostheses, and make recommendations concerning the study designs and outcome measures that best inform patient oriented function, quality of life, and service satisfaction in this realm. CMS will ensure there is opportunity for public comment and engagement on the Workgroup consensus statement and any related activities. </p>\n\n      <p>The federal government looks forward to working with the public to ensure appropriate access to prostheses. </p>\n\n      <p>Thanks so much for raising your voice around this issue -- and for your continued advocacy around it.</p>\n\n      <p>The We the People Team</p>",

      "title": "A Message from President Obama about Your Petition on Reducing Gun Violence",
      "body": "<p>By Bruce Reed</p><p>In the days since the tragedy in Newtown, Americans from all over the country have called for action to deter mass shootings and reduce gun violence. Hundreds of thousands of you have signed petitions on the White House's We the People petitions platform.</p>\n      <p>I&#39;m writing you today to thank you for speaking up, to update you on an important development, and to encourage you to continue engaging with the White House on this critical issue.</p>\n      <p>First, you should know that President Obama is paying close to attention to the public response to this tragedy. In fact, he sat down to record a message specifically for those of you who have joined the conversation using We the People. Watch it now: </p>\n      <p><iframe width=\"520\" height=\"293\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u5ynVMBxOus?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n      <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ynVMBxOus\" class=\"no-follow\">Watch this video on YouTube</a></p>\n      <p>On December 19, the President outlined a series of first steps we can take to begin the work of ending this cycle of violence. This is what he said:</p>\n      <p style=\"padding-left:30px; padding-right:30px; text-align:justify;\">We know this is a complex issue that stirs deeply held passions and political divides. And as I said on Sunday night, there&#39;s no law or set of laws that can prevent every senseless act of violence in our society. We&#39;re going to need to work on making access to mental health care at least as easy as access to a gun. We&#39;re going to need to look more closely at a culture that all too often glorifies guns and violence. And any actions we must take must begin inside the home and inside our hearts.</p>\n      <p style=\"padding-left:30px; padding-right:30px; text-align:justify;\">But the fact that this problem is complex can no longer be an excuse for doing nothing. The fact that we can&#39;t prevent every act of violence doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t steadily reduce the violence, and prevent the very worst violence.</p>\n      <p>Vice President Biden has been asked to work with members of the Administration, Congress, and the general public to come up with a set of concrete policy proposals by next month -- proposals the President intends to push swiftly. The President asked the Vice President to lead this effort in part because he wrote and passed the 1994 Crime Bill that helped law enforcement bring down the rate of violent crime in America. That bill included the assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004.</p>\n      <p>As the Vice President&#39;s Chief of Staff, I&#39;m going to do everything I can to ensure we run a process that includes perspectives from all sides of the issue, which is why I wanted to respond to your petition myself. Two decades ago, as domestic policy adviser in the Clinton White House, I first worked with Joe Biden as he fought to enact the Crime Bill, the assault weapons ban, and the Brady Bill. I will never forget what a key role the voices of concerned citizens like you played in that vital process.</p>\n      <p>The President called on Congress to pass important legislation \"banning the sale of military-style assault weapons,\" \"banning the sale of high-capacity ammunition clips,\" and \"requiring background checks before all gun purchases, so that criminals can’t take advantage of legal loopholes to buy a gun from somebody who won’t take the responsibility of doing a background check at all.\"</p>\n      <p>An issue this serious and complex isn&#39;t going to be resolved with a single legislative proposal or policy prescription. And let&#39;s be clear, any action we take will respect the Second Amendment. As the President said:</p>\n      <p style=\"padding-left:30px; padding-right:30px; text-align:justify;\">Look, like the majority of Americans, I believe that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms. This country has a strong tradition of gun ownership that&#39;s been handed down from generation to generation. Obviously across the country there are regional differences. There are differences between how people feel in urban areas and rural areas. And the fact is the vast majority of gun owners in America are responsible -- they buy their guns legally and they use them safely, whether for hunting or sport shooting, collection or protection.</p>\n      <p style=\"padding-left:30px; padding-right:30px; text-align:justify;\">But you know what, I am also betting that the majority -- the vast majority -- of responsible, law-abiding gun owners would be some of the first to say that we should be able to keep an irresponsible, law-breaking few from buying a weapon of war. I&#39;m willing to bet that they don&#39;t think that using a gun and using common sense are incompatible ideas -- that an unbalanced man shouldn&#39;t be able to get his hands on a military-style assault rifle so easily; that in this age of technology, we should be able to check someone&#39;s criminal records before he or she can check out at a gun show; that if we work harder to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, there would be fewer atrocities like the one in Newtown -- or any of the lesser-known tragedies that visit small towns and big cities all across America every day.</p>\n      <p>The President said it best: &quot;Ultimately if this effort is to succeed it&#39;s going to require the help of the American people -- it&#39;s going to require all of you. If we&#39;re going to change things, it&#39;s going to take a wave of Americans -- mothers and fathers, daughters and sons, pastors, law enforcement, mental health professionals -- and, yes, gun owners -- standing up and saying 'enough' on behalf of our kids.&quot;</p>\n      <p>So let&#39;s continue this conversation and get something meaningful done. If you have additional ideas and are interested in further engagement with the White House on this issue, please let us know and share your thoughts here:</p>\n      <p><a class=\"no-follow\" href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/share-your-thoughts-reducing-gun-violence\">http://www.whitehouse.gov/share-your-thoughts-reducing-gun-violence</a></p>\n      <p>Thank you for speaking out and staying involved.</p>\n      <p><em>Bruce Reed is Chief of Staff to Vice President Biden</em></p>",
