<h2>We the People API: Resources & Documentation</h2>
<p>In 2014, We the People officially launched a "write" version of the Petitions Application Programming Interface, or "API." Using the API, people can sign We the People petitions even when they’re not on WhiteHouse.gov. Now, users can also use third-party platforms, including other petitions services, or even their own websites or blogs to submit signatures and access publicly available data on petitions. All of those signatures, once validated, will count towards a petition’s objective of meeting the 100,000-signature threshold needed for an official White House response.</p>

<p>Below find resources and documentation to help you use the API.</p>
